## 🧠 What It Does

Using a trained Machine Learning model, this tracker predicts:
- 🔥 Your **focus level over the next 10 hours**
- ⚡ **Best time to consume caffeine** for peak productivity
- ⚠️ A **crash alert** if your focus is expected to dip significantly
- 📊 A dynamic graph showing your **hourly focus variation**

## 📘 Prediction Terms Explained

### ⚡ Optimal Caffeine Time
- The **time when your predicted focus level is the highest** after caffeine intake.
- This is the **best time to consume coffee** to maximize productivity.
- Based on your unique input of sleep, fatigue, and caffeine.

### 🔺 Peak Focus
- The **maximum focus level** predicted in the 10-hour window.
- Used to calculate both the optimal time and crash risk.

### ⚠️ Crash Alert Time
- If your predicted focus **drops by more than 30%** after the peak, the app flags a **crash time**.
- Helps users prepare for a dip in energy and plan breaks accordingly.

### 📊 Average Focus
- The **mean focus level** across the 10-hour period.
- Gives an overall picture of your **day’s energy quality**.
- *Coming soon*: Visible on dashboard for deeper insight.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User inputs:
   - Hours of sleep last night
   - Current fatigue level
   - Amount of caffeine intake (mg)

2. Backend (`/predict`) uses trained ML model to:
   - Predict a **base focus level**
   - Simulate hourly variations over 10 hours
   - Compute **optimal time** and **potential crash**

3. Frontend displays:
   - Focus graph
   - Optimal & crash alert cards
   - Loading spinner
